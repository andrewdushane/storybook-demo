# Intro to React-Storybook

React Storybook can help you develop React components more efficiently. It provides a sandboxed environment for visualizing React components. 

Storybook can also facilitate collaboration in groups of developers, and between developers and designers and other stakeholders in a project.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)
